Write a function that takes a string input, and returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string.

As an added challenge, upper- and lowercase letters are considered the same character, but the function should return the correct case for the initial letter. For example, the input 'sTreSS' should return 'T'.

If a string contains all repeating characters, it should return the empty string ("").
