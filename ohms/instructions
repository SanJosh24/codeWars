Resistors are electrical components marked with colorful stripes/bands to indicate both their resistance value in ohms and how tight a tolerance that value has. Remembering these bands is tricky, so let's write a function that will take a string identifying the resistor's ohms and return a string containing a resistor's band colors.

The resistor color codes
You can see this Wikipedia page for a colorful chart, but the basic resistor color codes are:

color:	black	brown	red	orange	yellow	green	blue	violet	gray	white
value:	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9
All resistors have at least three bands, with the first and second bands indicating the first two digits of the ohms value, and the third indicating the power of ten to multiply them by, for example a resistor with a value of 47 ohms, which equals 47 * 10^0 ohms, would have the three bands "yellow violet black".

Most resistors also have a fourth band indicating tolerance -- in an electronics kit like yours, the tolerance will always be 5%, which is indicated by a gold band. So in your kit, the 47-ohm resistor in the above paragraph would have the four bands "yellow violet black gold".

Your mission
Your function will receive a string containing the ohms value you need, followed by a space and the word ohms. The way an ohms value is formatted depends on the magnitude of the value:

For resistors less than 1,000 ohms, the ohms value is just formatted as the plain number. For example, with the 47-ohm resistor above, your function would receive the string "47 ohms", and return the string "yellow violet black gold".

For resistors greater than or equal to 1000 ohms, but less than 1,000,000 ohms, the ohms value is divided by 1,000, and has a lower-case "k" after it. For example, if your function received the string "4.7k ohms", it would need to return the string "yellow violet red gold".

For resistors of 1,000,000 ohms or greater, the ohms value is divided by 1,000,000, and has an upper-case "M" after it. For example, if your function received the string "1M ohms", it would need to return the string "brown black green gold".

Test case resistor values will all be between 10 ohms and 990M ohms.
